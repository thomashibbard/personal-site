        <b>Here is a bit about me:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began in print design in a time that feels like very long ago but probably isn't that long ago. Though I still obsess about typography and visual design, these days I appreciate well-designed software and well-designed user experiences equally. A respect for both disciplines means I love working in teams where the skills and idiosyncrasies of both designers and devs intersect and real ideas happen.    
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the office, I develop tools to simplify or fully automate adjacent teams' processes. I use Node/Express, Angular, jQuery (for nostalgia), and heaps of other JS libraries and modules to get the job done, along with some other scripting languages if a particular need for one arises. I spend my “exploring time” equally between learning about new frameworks/modules and getting more in-depth with ES6. I love Gulp and don’t know how I did my job without it, and I honestly don’t know how I ever got out of bed in the morning before compiled CSS.
