        <b>Here is a bit about me:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I began in print design in what feels like very long ago, though I still obsess about typography and visual design. These days I appreciate well-designed software and well-designed user experience equally. A respect for both disciplines means I love working in a team where the skills and idiosyncrasies of both designers and devs intersect and real ideas happen.    
      </p>

        At the office, I develop tools to simplify or fully automate their processes. I use Node/Express, Angular, jQuery (for nostalgia), and some other scripting languages if a particular need for it arises. I spend my “exploring time” equally between learning about new frameworks/modules and getting more in-depth with ES6. I love Gulp and don’t know how I did my job without it, and on a more personal note, don’t know how I got out of bed in the morning before compiled CSS.
